                    <p> The museum on water, otherwise known as Bay of Bones, is an archeological complex located at the excavation 
                        site of Ploca Micov Kamen, near Gradishte and Pestani along the Ohrid coast.In prehistoric times Lake Ohrid was
                         home to a settlement of pile dwellers who lived literally on top of the water, on a platform supported by up
                          to 10,000 wooden piles anchored to the lake bed. The remains of the settlement were discovered at this spot 
                          and were gradually excavated by an underwater team between 1997 and 2005; the museum is an elaborate
                           reconstruction of the settlement as archaeologists think it would have looked between 1200 and 600 BC.      </p>
