            <p>  Ohrid fortress, the symbol of the city without which its urban physiognomy and history can not be imagined
                 is one of the largest medieval fortification constructions in Macedonia. Just down under the church lies
                 the fishing settlement of Kaneo and the favorite town's beaches. In the past a fishing settlement, but 
                 today with its apartments, food, drinks, boats. it offers everything one tourist can just imagine. Here you
                 can hire a boat for a tour of the lake or you might simply stroll through the town Square St. Kliment to
                 the Old Bazaar full with small shops.
