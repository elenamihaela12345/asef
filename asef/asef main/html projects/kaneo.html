                <p> Saint John the Theologian, Kaneo or simply Saint John at Kaneo is a Macedonian Orthodox church situated on the cliff
                    over Kaneo Beach overlooking Lake Ohrid in the city of Ohrid, North Macedonia.
                    The church of Saint John the Theologian Kaneo is built during the 13th century. Standing alone on a cliff overlooking
                     the Lake of Ohrid, above the fishing settlement of Kaneo, it is one of the landmarks of the old town of Ohrid and a 
                     favourite symbol in the entire city. The architecture is a combination of Byzantine and Armenian elements. The very
                      impressive and the magnificent and masterly done decoration of bricks and tuff bricks, make this church one of the 
                      most recognizable medieval monuments not only in Ohrid, but also worldwide. Today, many visitors are coming to light
                       a candle and pray for their beloved ones, to get married in this small church devoted to Saint John the Theologian
                        and to enjoy the scenic area that will fill your soul and leave you without words.</p>
